  <p>My name is Andy von Dohren. I was a student in the inagrial class of Omaha Code School.<br /><br />
    
    This site is a summary of the work I have done. Please check out my project gallery, as well as my blog.<br /><br />

    During my time in OCS, I was fortunate enough to publish occational guest posts on Silicon Prairie News documenting our class. Make sure you give them a read.<br /></p>
