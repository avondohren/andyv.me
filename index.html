  <p>My name is Andy von Dohren. I was a student in the inaugural class of Omaha Code School.<br /><br />
    
This site is a summary of the work I have done. Please check out my project gallery, as well as my blog.<br /><br />

During my time at OCS, I was fortunate enough to publish occasional <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/tags/andy-von-dohren">guest posts</a> on <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com">Silicon Prairie News</a> documenting our class. Make sure you give them a read.</p>
