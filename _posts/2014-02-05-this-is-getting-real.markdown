It's official. I put my resignation notice in this morning. My last day of work is the 19th. Two short weeks away. Making it this far is an accomplishment. I decided to make a change for the better, and I have followed through with that decision. I'm proud of that.

Now the real work begins.

I am still making my way through the prework. When I started Ruby, there was quite a jump between the first lesson and the next. I think I will have to do some digging of my own to fill in the gaps. I'm nearing the end, just have command line and GIT to go. Hopefully I have stayed on top of it so that I can have a couple days to relax before Omaha Code School begins.
