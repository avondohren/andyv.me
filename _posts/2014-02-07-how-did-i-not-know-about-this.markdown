I [read a tweet](https://twitter.com/OmahaCodeSchool/status/431795805989507073) today from our lead instructor at Omaha Code School, [Sumeet Jain](https://twitter.com/sumeetjain). It was a link to [TechOmaha.com](http://http://techomaha.com/) where a presentation he gave was uploaded for us to watch. The presentation talked about Omaha Code School and how the class is set up. It was exactly what I have hoped this course would be. I would have loved to hear the Q&A session though.

What I was blown away by was the rest of the content on Tech Omaha. How did I not know about this? There is a calendar with all sorts of local meetups and events, and videos featuring overviews of local businesses. In addition to [Omaha Code School](http://techomaha.com/2014/02/1mc-omaha-code-school/), there are presentations from [Peggy Bank](http://techomaha.com/2013/12/jim-simon-peggy-bank/), [Hello Holidy](http://techomaha.com/2013/12/megan-hunt-sarah-lorsung-tvrdik-hello-holiday/), [Travefy](http://techomaha.com/2013/12/david-chait-travefy/), and [many more](http://techomaha.com/category/videos/). I instantly subscribed to their YouTube channel, and will be setting aside some time to view many of the videos.

I still cannot believe I did not find out about this site before today. I will definitely be checking out the videos and maybe even attend some of the meetings. You should check it out too.
