There is one question I have been asked repeatedly since I decided to attend Omaha Code School. Are you afraid/nervous about making such a big decision?

My answer is surprisingly simple. No. I am excited and ready to start this adventure. Understand, this is not like me at all. I have always needed to know what's next. I never thought I would be okay with not knowing, but this course has given me the freedom to embrace the unknown for 12 weeks. I know I will learn. I know I will grow. I know I will meet new friends and colleagues. But what I am looking forward to the most is knowing that something will come up in the next several months I don't even know about yet. And that is awesome!
