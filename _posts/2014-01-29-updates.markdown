Wow. There is a lot going on right now. Here is a quick summary.

We are 26 days away from starting Omaha Code School(OCS).

I found an affordable MacBook (Thanks everyone who helped find one for me).

Our prework is having us jump into HTML and CSS basics. Next up will be some Ruby.

Several of my classmates are still [raising funds](http://omahacodeschool.com/fundraising_campaigns). Please help them out if you can.

I'm not the only student blogging about my experience. Check what [other students are saying about OCS](http://omahacodeschool.com/student_blogs).

OCS has secured a location at Midtown Crossing to hold the class. Read more about it on [Omaha.com](http://www.omaha.com/article/20140123/MONEY/140129381/1707). They are looking for some used furniture (couches, chairs, desks) to help furnish the space. If you have anything, send [@OmahaCodeSchool](https://www.twitter.com/OmahaCodeSchool) a tweet to let him know.

So far, my experience blogging has been phenomenal. In the past week, I've had over 500 page views. I'm also working on reaching a larger audience once the class begins. More on this to come!

Overall, I am really excited about this opportunity. Everything that has happened since I signed up for OCS has reaffirmed my decision to go for it.

Follow this blog to get regular updates about what is going on. I'm shooting for 3 blogs a week, based on what is going on.
