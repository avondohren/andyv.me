A week ago we wrapped up our first group project. My team decided to create a Omaha Code School Wiki. It's a wiki about anything related to Omaha Code School. Anyone can read the articles we put together so far. You have to sign up for an account in order to add or modify the articles, but anyone can do it. Make sure you provide a legitimate email, because we figured out how to send email to confirm before we activate your account. We're pretty proud of that.

Here is the link for your enjoyment. Let me know what you think. It's on a free hosting service, so I apologize in advance if it's a little slow to respond.
