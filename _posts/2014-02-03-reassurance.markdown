Reassurance is a wonderful thing. There is nothing better than knowing you made the right choice. Knowing God has set a path for you, and you got off at the right exit.

Since I made the decision to go to Omaha Code School, everything that has happened around me has reinforced that I made the right choice. From the people I have been introduced to, to the ever-growing pile of bureaucracy I'm leaving behind. Everything is telling me to keep going. No matter how nervous I get about what lies next, or how bad I feel about leaving my team a man short, I need to do this.

Last night, a bunch of my closest friends came over to watch the Super Bowl and hang out. I had the opportunity to talk to them more about the class and what I'll be doing. They asked questions about what we will be learning. They commented about the extreme nature of not getting a day off. They even sounded a little envious of the potential field trips and exclusive job fair. Everyone was extremely supportive and excited that I get to pursue this opportunity. It means a lot for me to have a group of friends share their honest feedback and come away feeling even more excited and ready to jump in.
