Today Silicon Prairie News(SPN) published my new guest blog recapping the first four weeks of class. I'm writing a post about every-other week as a way to get the word out about what we are doing at Omaha Code School.

Please give it a read. [http://spne.ws/q0c](http://spne.ws/q0c)

If you don't know about SPN, they are a technology blog that focuses on the midwest. Primarily Omaha, Des Moines, and Kansas City. They are pretty well-known and have very loyal followers, so having the opportunity to write for them is a huge blessing.
