My classmates and I have been getting to know each other as we go through our prework. We have an incredibly diverse group of people enrolled. There is a neuroscientist, record producer, 3D printing guru, game designer, makers, students, and many more. Everybody seems really excited to get started. I am genuinely looking forward to meeting these people and getting to know them. Just reading their short bios and comments have been a really fun experience.

On February 13th, [Silicon Prairie News](http://www.siliconprairienews.com) is hosting a [meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/288668931285965/). Many of us are going to attend. Not just to meet in person, but to meet the members of the community we are about to join. I'm really excited and will do everything I can to attend. Hopefully you can come too.
