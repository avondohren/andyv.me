Wow! I'm blown away. Last night I passed 1,000 views on this blog. I am constantly surprised by the number of people who are reading my posts on a regular basis. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for the retweets, likes, shares, favorites, and pluses you have given my posts. It has really helped sustain my momentum. My goal going forward is to get the word out about what we are doing and learning in Omaha Code School. I hope that you get as much out of it as I do.

On another topic, tomorrow is the Silicon Prairie News meet-up. It's an opportunity for me to meet some of the entrepreneurs that live in our community. I have admired this group of people from the outside for a long time, but now I get the opportunity to meet them and join their community. I might get to meet a few of my future classmates too.
