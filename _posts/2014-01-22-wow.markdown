Thank you. The last couple of days have been amazing. I started this blog as a way to document my personal transition. I guessed maybe 10 people might read it. Yesterday I had 76! The number of positive comments and new connections have caught me completely off guard.

I also want to thank those of you that have reached out to your friends and family about potential laptop options. I greatly appreciate it. I am still looking for the right one, so let me know if something comes up.

I can't think of a better beginning to this adventure than what I have experienced so far. Just think, I still have 33 days before class begins!
