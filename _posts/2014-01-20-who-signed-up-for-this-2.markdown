I am officially enrolled in the inaugural class of the Omaha Code School.  The goal being to become a hireable web developer after 12 intense weeks of instruction. The class requires lots of changes in our lives. Mostly, the requirement that I quit my job. I don’t exactly know what I’m getting myself into. It’s a huge change and a big risk, but I’m ready. People think I’m crazy that I am quitting my good paying job and signing up for the unknown. I think it will be a good thing.

I got signed up for all the pre-work and gave it an overview. They suggested that we blog about our new adventure, which is why I’m doing this. Hopefully this creates a record of my adventure, and might just be a little entertaining.

Here we go…
