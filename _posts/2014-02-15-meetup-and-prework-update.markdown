Thursday was an amazing night. Silicon Prairie News hosted a meetup in Benson. Our class was invited to meet some members of the community and our fellow classmates. It was a lot of fun, even for an introvert like me. I made myself go up and introduce myself to Jeff Slobotski, co-founder of SPN. He was extremely nice and introduced me to a couple of Ruby developers. It was cool to meet some people working on what I want to do. Next week, we are going to have a smaller event just with Omaha Code School students. I am really looking forward to it.

Yesterday I woke up at 4:30 AM. I wasn't happy about it, but it gave me an opportunity to wrap up my prework. I learned about a version control method called GIT. It allows several people to work on the same project, and merge their updates together. It seems to work pretty well. I also finally finished my Ruby homework. The whole lesson we did seemed to be one step ahead of where I was at. I managed to get through it, but I definitely need more practice to really understand what I was doing.

Wednesday is my last day of work at Mutual of Omaha. I've been walking around the building trying to say thank you to the people who have worked with me over the years. It is kind of a bittersweet feeling. A lot of the people I have talked to have had a lot of good things to say about working with me. I really cherish their comments. Mutual is not the easiest place to make a difference, and it seems like I have.

Now I have a week to relax and get everything put together before class begins. I'm on the last downhill slide, and can see a cliff jetting upward in my future. Hopefully I can make the climb and come out on top. Only time will tell. Until then, I'll enjoy a little relaxation.
