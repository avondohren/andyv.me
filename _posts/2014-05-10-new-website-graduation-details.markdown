**[http://andyv.me](andyv.me)** just launched! It’s a new portfolio website where I can show off some of the projects I have worked on, and get the word out about some of the skills we have learned over the past 12 weeks. I will also continue to blog there after Omaha Code School is over. I would love to get a little feedback about what I have put together.

Friday is graduation day. I can hardly believe it’s already here. We have transitioned from our intense learning style to a more relaxed week working on getting our resume put together. We had a full week of guest speakers come in and walk us through the interview process and give mock interviews. It’s been a while since I’ve gone through this, so I really appreciate the practice.

Everyone is invited to our graduation party! This Friday, May 16th, at 6pm we will be having a graduation celebration at Omaha Code School. Everyone is invited. There will be plenty of food and drink to go around. We will also be having a short presentation. While your mingling, ask us if you can see our other projects, we will be happy to give you a quick look.
